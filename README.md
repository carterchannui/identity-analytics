## Reflection

Our goal was to create an analytics tool that visualizes gateway token usage in the gateway protocol. This assignment was especially memorable because of the freedom we had in creating a design document. We were allowed to start the project from scratch, come up with our own solutions, and implement any technologies. First, we had to decide how we would manage the data flow. We used fast-csv to parse the csv data and re-chart to create a graph from it. We also used the Chakra UI library to improve the user experience. React was used for our project because component-based programming allows programmers to collaborate more easily. We also used Git to easily manage the source code version. We also kept the code-reviewer and collaborators in mind, and implemented a prettier library to auto-format our codebase and adhere to the airbnb-style guide.
